# Text Summarization Using Matrix Factorization
## Data preprocessing
The preface section of Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition), which is known as CLRS, was considered as the input text. This section of the book is approximately 7 pages long and contains 156 sentences. All ounctuations and stop words were removed from the text and the words were stemmed. TD-IDF matrix were created for the text.
## Singular Value Dicomposition (SVD)
this method can be called first rank approximate of the matrix.
